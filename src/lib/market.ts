// One codebase, three deployments — each domain serves a different market:
//
//   seoexpertagency.com  → global. SEO pages carry NO country or state.
//   seoexpertagency.uk   → United Kingdom. Country is fixed to UK; the State
//                          dropdown lists UK locations.
//   seoexpertagency.ae   → United Arab Emirates. Country fixed to UAE; the
//                          State dropdown lists the emirates.
//
// The market is a property of the DEPLOYMENT, not of the content — an admin on
// the .ae site should never be choosing between "United Arab Emirates" and
// "United Kingdom", and an admin on .com should not see a country field at all.
//
// Set NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET explicitly in each Vercel project (AE | GB | XX).
//
// The fallback deliberately does NOT read `.com` as global. NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
// is `https://seoexpertagency.com` on the live AE deployment — a `.com` there
// means "nobody has updated this yet", not "this is the global site". Inferring
// XX from it would silently strip the Country and State fields off the very
// site that needs them. Only the two unambiguous TLDs are inferred; the global
// build must declare NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET=XX, which is right for the one mode
// that removes fields rather than adding them.
